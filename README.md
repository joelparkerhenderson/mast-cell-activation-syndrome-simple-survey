# Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS) Simple Survey

This project is a Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS) simple survey that helps
you choose your symptoms and calculate an estimate of whether you may have MCAS
or not. The higher your score, the more likely you are to have Mast Cell
Activation Syndrome. If you have a score over 50, investigate whether you might
have Mast Cell Activation Syndrome.
