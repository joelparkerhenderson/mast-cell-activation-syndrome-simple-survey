# Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS) Simple Survey

This project is a Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS) simple survey that helps
you choose your symptoms and calculate an estimate of whether you may have MCAS
or not. The higher your score, the more likely you are to have Mast Cell
Activation Syndrome. If you have a score over 50, investigate whether you might
have Mast Cell Activation Syndrome.

The survey was developed by Beth O'Hara for their Masterâ€™s Thesis and Doctoral
Dissertation. This is based on the work of top experts in the field and Dr.
O'Hara's own clinical observations of thousands of people with Mast Cell
Activation Syndrome (Afrin L. B., 2016) (Afrin L. B., 2013) (Akin, Valent, &
Metcalfe, 2010) (Theoharis C.Theoharides, et. al., 2012).

The project technology implementation was developed by [Joel Parker
Henderson](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson) with HTML, CSS using PureCSS,
JavaScript using AlpineJS, and source code hosting using GitHub.
